# 2025 Mw-7.7 Earthquake Impact Assessment in Myanmar and Thailand using Remote Sensing Data

## Project Overview
MyanmarEQ2025 is a collaborative volunteer project under IMPACTSquad, focused on assessing post-earthquake building damage in Myanmar following the 2025 seismic event. The goal is to support rapid damage assessment using remote sensing data, image signal processing methods, and collaborative mapping tools.

## Project Objectives
- Rapid post-disaster building damage assessment using EO data and various signal processing methods
- Visualize damage information through an interactive web map
- Openly share geospatial data and findings for public and academic use

## Areas of Interest

## Data & Methods
The project utilizes pre- and post-event satellite imagery, machine learning-based classification, and crowdsourced tagging to identify and categorize building damage levels across affected regions.

Key components:
- Building tagging outputs from volunteers
- Damage classification based on change detection (amplitude/coherence)
- Post-processing to reduce false positives
- Visualization through Mapbox-based interactive maps
